# Work In Progress

# StreamDeckSharp

This framework will allow you to easily and quickly create plugins for the Elgato Stream Deck software.

All communication with the Stream Deck application is handled through the internal client so you can focus on implementing your actions.

In addition to easy creation of plugins this framework also includes dependency injection and allows you to generate a manifest by simply running the binary without any arguments.


## Usage
